# project7

We implemented a chat functionality and the feature of adding classes for this week. 

Our target audience will test this feature by using our feature from last week (filtering matches) and then clicking chat when they find someone who they want to talk to. Then, they're taken to a personalized chat page where they can message with the other person.
For add classes, the user will first select the department of the class and then the number. The classes that they add will be viewable at the bottom of the screen and then will prompt the user to view their matches based on the classes that they entered.
