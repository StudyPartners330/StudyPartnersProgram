We implemented a user profile component such that our interface may 
provide personalized content for each user.

Our target audience will test this feature by navigating the screen (index.html) 
which provides two options: sign in or sign up.
We will then test whether the profile creation process is intuitive and easy to
navigate depending on user needs (ex: clicked the wrong button and need to go back,
knows how to submit the form which creates their profile or logs them in,
knows which fields are required)
